breadboard
============
____
A **breadboard** *(or protoboard)* is a construction base for prototyping of electronics. The term "breadboard" is commonly used to refer to a solderless breadboard *(plugboard)*.

Because the solderless breadboard does not require soldering, it is reusable. This makes it easy to use for creating **temporary prototypes** and **experimenting** with circuit design.

Breadboard is a testing site for ideas and bug discovery.

Many times I need to find a bug so need a place to input some code and try to narrow it down to a spacific location.  This leads to a random page in my xampp file that before long meens nothing, or worse I play with an idea that becomes something i would like to turn into something grand or something that someday i need to see "how the hell did i do that".

Enter **Breadboard**, a playground of sorts.  In a nutshell it's a simple php site that that has a way of creating pages quickly by adding a php page of variables that point to an html page of the code in question and or a js page as well.

For plugin testing, bower is used to populate the assets/components folder.  From there a boolean is used in the variables page to turn on and off the plugins needed for the page.

Rather elemantary and kinda more or less a place for me to play...
