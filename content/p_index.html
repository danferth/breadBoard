<p>This project is for testing purposes.  Please create a new page with the code needed to conduct the test required.  The index page should not have any code on it as it is a landing page only.  You can find a set of links below that will take you to verious test for sippets and such, although good snippets should always make it into a gist on <a href="http://github.com">github</a>.  Following is some random ipsum pulled for paragraph completion as I am at work and can not spend time coming up with random stories... or can I</p>
	<p>Every year, I took a holiday. I went to Florence, this cafe on the banks of the Arno. Every fine evening, I would sit there and order a Fernet Branca. I had this fantasy, that I would look across the tables and I would see you there with a wife maybe a couple of kids. You wouldn't say anything to me, nor me to you. But we would both know that you've made it, that you were happy. I never wanted you to come back to Gotham. I always knew there was nothing here for you except pain and tragedy and I wanted something more for you than that. I still do.</p>
